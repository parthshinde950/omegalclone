                    Omegle (oh·meg·ull) is a great way to meet new friends. When you use Omegle, you are paired randomly
                    with another person to talk one-on-one. If you prefer, you can add your interests and you’ll be
                    randomly
                    paired with someone who selected some of the same interests.

                recommended!), and you can stop a chat at any time. See our Terms of Service and Community Guidelines
                for more info about the do’s and don’ts in using Omegle. Omegle video chat is moderated but no
                moderation is perfect. Users are solely responsible for their behavior while using Omegle.
